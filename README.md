This is a minimal Vite + React project containing the Game Studio (Basma Games).
It includes:

How to use:

I included a GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/deploy.yml in the ZIP so you can push this repo to GitHub and enable Pages via GitHub Actions (automatic deploy). See instructions in the repository after uploading.
